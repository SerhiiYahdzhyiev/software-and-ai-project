# Abstract

In software development, reinventing the wheel is generally considered bad
practice. However, reusing code written by others introduces significant risks.
Identifying imperfections in reused programs or code snippets can be
challenging without thorough analysis, which can be time-consuming. This
project leverages the [Web Extensions API](#) and modern [AI]() to create a
universal tool for code analysis and summarization, accelerating the overall
development process.
