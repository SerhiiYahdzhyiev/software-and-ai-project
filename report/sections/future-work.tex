\section{Future Work}

As a future improvements for CodeGlass project (based on its state by the time
of this reports submission) we formulated the following points:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improve documentation on writing custom (user) \emph{Adapter Clients}.
    \item Improve errors displaying in on the extension's (front-end) part.
    \item Formalize/design an approach for testing the quality of LLM's responses,
        in order to benchmark different Adapter Clients.
    \item Apply prompt engineering in order to improve the model outputs.
    \item Improve mechanism responsible for popover element positioning on the
        web page.
\end{itemize}

There are also planned improvement that will not directly affect the User Experience,
but rather improve maintainability and reliability of the code base:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement automated unit, integration and end-to-end testing. Primarily
        for the non-AI components of the project's setup (application server,
        extension's functions).
    \item Integrate TypeScript in order to boost code readability and
        maintainability.
    \item Add linting and formatting tools to the project.
    \item Integrate a tool for automatic API documentation generation from the
        source code.
\end{itemize}
