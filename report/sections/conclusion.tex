\section{Conclusion}

CodeGlass introduces an AI-powered approach to code analysis, seamlessly
integrating into web browsing to enhance software development workflows. By
leveraging the Web Extensions API and LLMs, it provides real-time insights into
code quality. The modular design ensures flexibility, allowing developers to
customize and self-host the tool as needed. While the project successfully
demonstrates the feasibility of AI-assisted code review, future improvementsâ€”such
as better error handling, benchmarking methodologies, and enhanced testing will
further refine its reliability and usability.

Ultimately, CodeGlass aims to bridge the gap between efficient code reuse and
rigorous analysis, contributing to a more streamlined and informed development
process.
