\section{Introduction}

In modern software development, code reuse is a widely accepted practice that
allows developers to save time, reduce redundancy, and leverage existing solutions.
However, integrating third-party code snippets or libraries into projects introduces 
risks, such as hidden bugs, security vulnerabilities, and
performance inefficiencies, which can significantly impact the stability and
maintainability of software. Identifying those issues often requires extensive
manual reviews, analysis and/or researches.Those can be time-consuming and
resource-intensive.

With the advent of Large Language Models and their rapid advancements in
understanding and generating human-like text, it has become possible to automate
aspects of initial code analysis and summarization. This project proposes to
assist developers in assessing and understanding code snippets (or even bigger
code parts if needed) that they encounter while doing research on the web. By
leveraging the Web Extensions API \autocite{CFD} and integrating LLM-based
processing, the project provides real-time insights into code quality,
potential errors, and optimization suggestions.

A key feature of this solution is its modularity. The extension itself handles
the UI and workflow, while the AI processing is delegated to a small locally hosted
server, which acts as an intermediary, encapsulating the core
logic and flow of code analysis whiles allowing users to choose and configure their
preferred LLMs. This approach ensures flexibility, enabling developers
to tailor the tool to their specific needs and integrate different
AI models without need for modifying the core logic.

By embedding AI-powered code analysis directly into the web browsing experience,
CodeGlass aims to enhance the efficiency of software development and research
processes. Developers can receive nearly immediate feedback on code parts that
need analysis, enabling a more informed approach to code reuse.
