\section*{Abstract}

In software development, reinventing the wheel is generally considered a bad
practice. However, reusing code written by others introduces significant risks,
such as undetected bugs and performance drawbacks. Identifying imperfections in
reused programs or code snippets can be challenging without thorough analysis,
which can be time-consuming. This project leverages the Web Extensions API and
modern LLMs to create a universal tool for code analysis and summarization,
that can be smoothly integrated into daily browsing routines, allowing
developers to accelerate the overall development and research process.
